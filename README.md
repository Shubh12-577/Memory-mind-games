    - **Emotional Manipulation**: Techniques that play on someone's feelings to achieve a desired outcome. This can include guilt-tripping, playing the victim, or giving mixed signals.
    - **Strategic Thinking**: Activities that require careful planning and foresight, often used in competitive environments. Examples include chess, poker, or strategic business decisions.
    - **Cognitive Challenges**: Puzzles and games designed to stimulate mental faculties and improve cognitive functions. Examples include Sudoku, crosswords, and brainteasers.

2. **Purpose of Mind Games**:
